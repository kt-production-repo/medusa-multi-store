# Write Integration Tests

In this chapter, you'll learn about `medusaIntegrationTestRunner` from Medusa's Testing Framework and how to use it to write integration tests.

### Prerequisites

- [Testing Tools Setup](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/debugging-and-testing/testing-tools)

## medusaIntegrationTestRunner Utility

The `medusaIntegrationTestRunner` is from Medusa's Testing Framework and it's used to create integration tests in your Medusa project. It runs a full Medusa application, allowing you test API routes, workflows, or other customizations.

For example:

```ts title="integration-tests/http/test.spec.ts"
import { medusaIntegrationTestRunner } from "@medusajs/test-utils"

medusaIntegrationTestRunner({
  testSuite: ({ api, getContainer }) => {
    // TODO write tests...
  },
})

jest.setTimeout(60 * 1000)
```

The `medusaIntegrationTestRunner` function accepts an object as a parameter. The object has a required property `testSuite`.

`testSuite`'s value is a function that defines the tests to run. The function accepts as a parameter an object that has the following properties:

- `api`: a set of utility methods used to send requests to the Medusa application. It has the following methods:
  - `get`: Send a `GET` request to an API route.
  - `post`: Send a `POST` request to an API route.
  - `delete`: Send a `DELETE` request to an API route.
- `getContainer`: a function that retrieves the Medusa Container. Use the `getContainer().resolve` method to resolve resources from the Medusa Container.

The tests in the `testSuite` function are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

### Jest Timeout

Since your tests connect to the database and perform actions that require more time than the typical tests, make sure to increase the timeout in your test:

```ts title="integration-tests/http/test.spec.ts"
// in your test's file
jest.setTimeout(60 * 1000)
```

***

### Run Tests

Run the following command to run your tests:

```bash
npm run test:integration:http
```

If you don't have a `test:integration:http` script in `package.json`, refer to the [Medusa Testing Tools chapter](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/debugging-and-testing/testing-tools#add-test-commands).

This runs your Medusa application and runs the tests available under the `src/integrations/http` directory.

***

## Other Options and Inputs

Refer to [the Test Tooling Reference](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/test-tools-reference/medusaIntegrationTestRunner) for other available parameter options and inputs of the `testSuite` function.

***

## Database Used in Tests

The `medusaIntegrationTestRunner` function creates a database with a random name before running the tests. Then, it drops that database after all the tests end.

To manage that database, such as changing its name or perform operations on it in your tests, refer to [the Test Tooling Reference](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/test-tools-reference/medusaIntegrationTestRunner).

## Example Integration Tests

The next chapters provide examples of writing integration tests for API routes and workflows.
