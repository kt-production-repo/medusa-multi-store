# Stock Location Module

In this section of the documentation, you will find resources to learn more about the Stock Location Module and how to use it in your application.

Refer to the [Medusa Admin User Guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/user-guide/settings/locations-and-shipping) to learn how to manage stock locations using the dashboard.

Medusa has stock location related features available out-of-the-box through the Stock Location Module. A [module](https://docs.medusajs.com/docs/learn/fundamentals/modules) is a standalone package that provides features for a single domain. Each of Medusa's commerce features are placed in Commerce Modules, such as this Stock Location Module.

Learn more about why modules are isolated in [this documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/docs/learn/fundamentals/modules/isolation).

## Stock Location Features

- [Stock Location Management](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/stock-location-next/models): Store and manage stock locations. Medusa links stock locations with data models of other modules that require a location, such as the [Inventory Module's InventoryLevel](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/commerce-modules/stock-location/links-to-other-modules).
- [Address Management](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/stock-location-next/models/StockLocationAddress): Manage the address of each stock location.

## How to Use Stock Location Module's Service

In your Medusa application, you build flows around Commerce Modules. A flow is built as a [Workflow](https://docs.medusajs.com/docs/learn/fundamentals/workflows), which is a special function composed of a series of steps that guarantees data consistency and reliable roll-back mechanism.

You can build custom workflows and steps. You can also re-use Medusa's workflows and steps, which are provided by the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

For example:

```ts title="src/workflows/create-stock-location.ts"
import { 
  createWorkflow, 
  WorkflowResponse,
  createStep,
  StepResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

const createStockLocationStep = createStep(
  "create-stock-location",
  async ({}, { container }) => {
    const stockLocationModuleService = container.resolve(Modules.STOCK_LOCATION)

    const stockLocation = await stockLocationModuleService.createStockLocations({
      name: "Warehouse 1",
    })

    return new StepResponse({ stockLocation }, stockLocation.id)
  },
  async (stockLocationId, { container }) => {
    if (!stockLocationId) {
      return
    }
    const stockLocationModuleService = container.resolve(Modules.STOCK_LOCATION)

    await stockLocationModuleService.deleteStockLocations([stockLocationId])
  }
)

export const createStockLocationWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "create-stock-location",
  () => {
    const { stockLocation } = createStockLocationStep()

    return new WorkflowResponse({ stockLocation })
  }
)
```

You can then execute the workflow in your custom API routes, scheduled jobs, or subscribers:

### API Route

```ts title="src/api/workflow/route.ts"
import type {
  MedusaRequest,
  MedusaResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/http"
import { createStockLocationWorkflow } from "../../workflows/create-stock-location"

export async function GET(
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) {
  const { result } = await createStockLocationWorkflow(req.scope)
    .run()

  res.send(result)
}
```

### Subscriber

```ts title="src/subscribers/user-created.ts"
import {
  type SubscriberConfig,
  type SubscriberArgs,
} from "@medusajs/framework"
import { createStockLocationWorkflow } from "../workflows/create-stock-location"

export default async function handleUserCreated({
  event: { data },
  container,
}: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
  const { result } = await createStockLocationWorkflow(container)
    .run()

  console.log(result)
}

export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
  event: "user.created",
}
```

### Scheduled Job

```ts title="src/jobs/run-daily.ts"
import { MedusaContainer } from "@medusajs/framework/types"
import { createStockLocationWorkflow } from "../workflows/create-stock-location"

export default async function myCustomJob(
  container: MedusaContainer
) {
  const { result } = await createStockLocationWorkflow(container)
    .run()

  console.log(result)
}

export const config = {
  name: "run-once-a-day",
  schedule: `0 0 * * *`,
}
```
