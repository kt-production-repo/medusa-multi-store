# Product Module

In this section of the documentation, you will find resources to learn more about the Product Module and how to use it in your application.

Refer to the [Medusa Admin User Guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/user-guide/products) to learn how to manage products using the dashboard.

Medusa has product related features available out-of-the-box through the Product Module. A [module](https://docs.medusajs.com/docs/learn/fundamentals/modules) is a standalone package that provides features for a single domain. Each of Medusa's commerce features are placed in Commerce Modules, such as this Product Module.

Learn more about why modules are isolated in [this documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/docs/learn/fundamentals/modules/isolation).

## Product Features

- [Products Management](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/product/models/Product): Store and manage products. Products have custom options, such as color or size, and each variant in the product sets the value for these options.
- [Product Organization](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/product/models): The Product Module provides different data models used to organize products, including categories, collections, tags, and more.
- [Bundled and Multi-Part Products](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/commerce-modules/inventory/inventory-kit): Create and manage inventory kits for a single product, allowing you to implement use cases like bundled or multi-part products.
- [Tiered Pricing and Price Rules](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/commerce-modules/pricing/price-rules): Set prices for product variants with tiers and rules, allowing you to create complex pricing strategies.

## How to Use the Product Module

In your Medusa application, you build flows around Commerce Modules. A flow is built as a [Workflow](https://docs.medusajs.com/docs/learn/fundamentals/workflows), which is a special function composed of a series of steps that guarantees data consistency and reliable roll-back mechanism.

You can build custom workflows and steps. You can also re-use Medusa's workflows and steps, which are provided by the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

For example:

```ts title="src/workflows/create-product.ts"
import { 
  createWorkflow, 
  WorkflowResponse,
  createStep,
  StepResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

const createProductStep = createStep(
  "create-product",
  async ({}, { container }) => {
    const productService = container.resolve(Modules.PRODUCT)

    const product = await productService.createProducts({
      title: "Medusa Shirt",
      options: [
        {
          title: "Color",
          values: ["Black", "White"],
        },
      ],
      variants: [
        {
          title: "Black Shirt",
          options: {
            Color: "Black",
          },
        },
      ],
    })

    return new StepResponse({ product }, product.id)
  },
  async (productId, { container }) => {
    if (!productId) {
      return
    }
    const productService = container.resolve(Modules.PRODUCT)

    await productService.deleteProducts([productId])
  }
)

export const createProductWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "create-product",
  () => {
    const { product } = createProductStep()

    return new WorkflowResponse({
      product,
    })
  }
)
```

You can then execute the workflow in your custom API routes, scheduled jobs, or subscribers:

### API Route

```ts title="src/api/workflow/route.ts"
import type {
  MedusaRequest,
  MedusaResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/http"
import { createProductWorkflow } from "../../workflows/create-product"

export async function GET(
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) {
  const { result } = await createProductWorkflow(req.scope)
    .run()

  res.send(result)
}
```

### Subscriber

```ts title="src/subscribers/user-created.ts"
import {
  type SubscriberConfig,
  type SubscriberArgs,
} from "@medusajs/framework"
import { createProductWorkflow } from "../workflows/create-product"

export default async function handleUserCreated({
  event: { data },
  container,
}: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
  const { result } = await createProductWorkflow(container)
    .run()

  console.log(result)
}

export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
  event: "user.created",
}
```

### Scheduled Job

```ts title="src/jobs/run-daily.ts"
import { MedusaContainer } from "@medusajs/framework/types"
import { createProductWorkflow } from "../workflows/create-product"

export default async function myCustomJob(
  container: MedusaContainer
) {
  const { result } = await createProductWorkflow(container)
    .run()

  console.log(result)
}

export const config = {
  name: "run-once-a-day",
  schedule: `0 0 * * *`,
}
```
