# Install Medusa

In this chapter, you'll learn how to install and run a Medusa application.

## Get Started with AI Agents

If you're an AI agent, or a human that wants to get started quickly with an AI agent, run the following prompt in your agent:

```bash title="Prompt"
Fetch https://docs.medusajs.com/start and create an ecommerce store with Medusa Cloud
```

The AI agent will set up Medusa locally, deploy it to [Cloud](https://docs.medusajs.com/cloud), and help you build your custom commerce features.

***

## Get Started with Cloud

[Cloud](https://docs.medusajs.com/cloud) is the quickest way to get started with Medusa. With Cloud, you can deploy your ecommerce applications in minutes. Benefit from features like:

## Create Medusa Application Locally

Medusa is open-source, so you can also install and run it locally on your machine. This is a great option if you want to have more control over your development environment.

A Medusa application is made up of a Node.js server and a Vite admin dashboard. You can optionally install the [Next.js Starter Storefront](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/nextjs-starter) either while installing the Medusa application or at a later point.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js v20.19.0+ or v22.12.0+ (LTS versions only). If you choose to install the Next.js Starter Storefront, make sure to use Node v24 LTS or lower.](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Git CLI tool](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [PostgreSQL installed and running](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

To create a Medusa application, use the `create-medusa-app` command:

Consider using `yarn` or `pnpm` as your package manager for quicker installations and better performance. `npm` installations are generally slower.

### yarn

```bash
yarn dlx create-medusa-app@latest my-medusa-store
# npx create-medusa-app@latest my-medusa-store --use-yarn
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm dlx create-medusa-app@latest my-medusa-store
# npx create-medusa-app@latest my-medusa-store --use-pnpm
```

### npm

```bash
npx create-medusa-app@latest my-medusa-store
```

Where `my-medusa-store` is the name of the project's directory, and the PostgreSQL database created for the project will be of the name `medusa-my-medusa-store`. When you run the command, you'll be asked whether you want to install the Next.js Starter Storefront.

To customize the default installation behavior, such as specify a database URL, refer to the [create-medusa-app reference](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/create-medusa-app).

After answering the prompts, the command installs the Medusa application in a monorepository. The backend (with the admin dashboard) is installed in the `apps/backend` directory of the monorepository.

If you chose to install the storefront with the Medusa application, the storefront is installed in the monorepository under the `apps/storefront` directory.

### Successful Installation Result

Once the installation finishes successfully, the Medusa application will run at `http://localhost:9000`.

The Medusa Admin dashboard also runs at `http://localhost:9000/app`. The installation process opens the Medusa Admin dashboard in your default browser to create a user. You can later log in with that user.

If you also installed the Next.js Starter Storefront, it'll be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

You can stop the servers for the Medusa application and Next.js Starter Storefront by exiting the installation command. To run the server for the Medusa application again, refer to the [Run Medusa Application in Development](#run-medusa-application-in-development) section.

### Troubleshooting Installation Errors

If you ran into an error during your installation, refer to the following troubleshooting guides for help:

1. [create-medusa-app troubleshooting guides](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/troubleshooting/create-medusa-app-errors).
2. [CORS errors](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/troubleshooting/cors-errors).
3. [Errors with pnpm](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/troubleshooting/pnpm).
4. [All troubleshooting guides](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/troubleshooting).

If you can't find your error reported anywhere, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/issues/new/choose).

***

## Run Medusa Application in Development

To run the Medusa application in development, change to the `backend` application's directory and run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs your Medusa server at `http://localhost:9000`, and the Medusa Admin dashboard `http://localhost:9000/app`.

![Diagram showcasing the server and application running when you start the Medusa application](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1776755500/Medusa%20Book/start-overview_hqjexd.jpg)

For details on starting and configuring the Next.js Starter Storefront, refer to [the Next.js Starter Storefront documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/nextjs-starter).

The application will restart if you make any changes to code under the `src` directory, except for admin customizations which are hot reloaded, providing you with a seamless developer experience without having to refresh your browser to see the changes.

## Start Building with AI Agents

Medusa provides [agentic skills](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa-agent-skills) to assist you in learning and building with Medusa using AI agents like Claude Code.

### Build Features with AI Agents

Medusa provides a set of skills to help you build features with AI agents. You can build features like product reviews, wishlists, quote requests, and more with AI agents.

This skill is ideal for all developers and non-technical users who want to build features with the help of AI agents.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude # start claude code
/plugin marketplace add medusajs/medusa-agent-skills
/plugin install medusa-dev@medusa

# Ask Claude Code to build features with the medusa-dev plugin. For example:
Help me implement a product reviews feature. Authenticated customers can add reviews. Admin users can view and approve or reject reviews from the dashboard
```

### Other AI Agents

```bash
npx skills add medusajs/medusa-agent-skills
# choose the following skills:
# - building-with-medusa
# - building-admin-dashboard-customizations
# - building-storefronts
# - db-generate
# - db-migrate
# - new-user

# Ask your AI agent to build features with the installed skills. For example:
Help me implement a product reviews feature. Authenticated customers can add reviews. Admin users can view and approve or reject reviews from the dashboard
```

By following this flow, you can quickly bring your business ideas to life with the help of AI agents, without having to worry about the underlying code or technical details.

### Learn Medusa Development with AI Agents

If you're a Medusa beginner and you want to learn Medusa development with the help of an AI agent, install and use the `learn-medusa` skills:

### Claude Code

```bash
claude # start claude code
/plugin marketplace add medusajs/medusa-agent-skills
/plugin install learn-medusa@medusa

# then use the following prompt to start learning:
I want to learn Medusa.
```

### Other AI Agents

```bash
npx skills add medusajs/medusa-agent-skills
# choose the following skill:
# - learning-medusa

# then use the following prompt in your AI agent to start learning:
I want to learn Medusa.
```

This starts the interactive learning experience where you'll learn Medusa concepts step-by-step by building a brands feature, similar to the [Brands tutorial](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/customization/custom-features). You will:

1. Create a Brand Module with API routes to manage brands.
2. Link brands to products to associate products with brands.
3. Customize the Medusa Admin dashboard to allow admin users to manage brands.

By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of Medusa's architecture and how to build custom features.

***

## Create Medusa Admin User

Aside from creating an admin user in the admin dashboard, you can create a user with Medusa's CLI tool.

Run the following command in your Medusa application's directory (`apps/backend`) to create a new admin user:

```bash
npx medusa user -e admin@medusajs.com -p supersecret
```

Replace `admin@medusajs.com` and `supersecret` with the user's email and password respectively.

You can then use the user's credentials to log into the Medusa Admin application.

***

## Project Files

Your Medusa application's project (`apps/backend`) will have the following files and directories:

![A diagram of the directories overview](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1732803813/Medusa%20Book/medusa-dir-overview_v7ks0j.jpg)
