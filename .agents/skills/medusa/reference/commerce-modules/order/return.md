# Order Return

In this document, you’ll learn about order returns.

Refer to this [Medusa Admin User Guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/user-guide/orders/returns) to learn how to manage an order's returns using the dashboard.

## What is a Return?

A return is the return of items delivered from the customer back to the merchant. It is represented by the [Return data model](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/order/models/Return).

A return is requested either by the customer from the storefront, or the merchant from the admin. Medusa supports an automated Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) flow.

The [Create Return API route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store/returns/create-return) doesn't require customer authentication, so that guest customers can request a return for their orders. To add access rules to the route, refer to the [Restrict Return Creation guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/commerce-modules/order/secure-return-creation).

Once the merchant receives the returned items, they mark the return as received.

## Returned Items

The items to be returned are represented by the [ReturnItem data model](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/order/models/ReturnItem).

The `ReturnItem` model has two properties storing the item's quantity:

1. `received_quantity`: The quantity of the item that's received and can be added to the item's inventory quantity.
2. `damaged_quantity`: The quantity of the item that's damaged, meaning it can't be sold again or added to the item's inventory quantity.

## Return Shipping Methods

A return has shipping methods used to return the items to the merchant. The shipping methods are represented by the [OrderShippingMethod data model](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/order/models/OrderShippingMethod).

In the Medusa application, the shipping method for a return is created only from a shipping option, provided by the Fulfillment Module, that has the rule `is_return` enabled.

***

## Refund Payment

The `refund_amount` property of the `Return` data model holds the amount a merchant must refund the customer.

The [OrderTransaction data model](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/order/models/OrderTransaction) represents the refunds made for the return.

***

## Returns in Exchanges and Claims

When a merchant creates an exchange or a claim, it includes returning items from the customer.

The `Return` data model also represents the return of these items. In this case, the return is associated with the exchange or claim it was created for.

## How Returns Impact an Order’s Version

The order’s version is incremented when:

1. A return is requested.
2. A return is marked as received.
