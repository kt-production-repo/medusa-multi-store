# Run Workflow Steps in Parallel

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to run workflow steps in parallel.

## parallelize Utility Function

If your workflow has steps that don’t rely on one another’s results, run them in parallel using `parallelize` from the Workflows SDK.

The workflow waits until all steps passed to the `parallelize` function finish executing before continuing to the next step.

For example:

```ts
import {
  createWorkflow,
  WorkflowResponse,
  parallelize,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import {
  createProductStep,
  getProductStep,
  createPricesStep,
  attachProductToSalesChannelStep,
} from "./steps"

interface WorkflowInput {
  title: string
}

const myWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "my-workflow", 
  (input: WorkflowInput) => {
   const product = createProductStep(input)

   const [prices, productSalesChannel] = parallelize(
     createPricesStep(product),
     attachProductToSalesChannelStep(product)
   )

   const refetchedProduct = getProductStep(product.id)

   return new WorkflowResponse(refetchedProduct)
 }
)
```

The `parallelize` function accepts the steps to run in parallel as a parameter.

It returns an array of the steps' results in the same order they're passed to the `parallelize` function.

So, `prices` is the result of `createPricesStep`, and `productSalesChannel` is the result of `attachProductToSalesChannelStep`.
