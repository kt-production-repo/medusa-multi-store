# Integrations

You can integrate any third-party service to Medusa, including storage services, notification systems, Content-Management Systems (CMS), etc… By integrating third-party services, you build flows and synchronize data around these integrations, making Medusa not only your commerce application, but a middleware layer between your data sources and operations.

Medusa provides integrations out-of-the-box that are listed here, but you can also create your own integrations, such as integrating ERP systems, as explained in [this guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/docs/learn/customization/integrate-systems).

This section holds guides to help technical teams add integrations to a Medusa application. If you're not a technical user, refer your technical team to this documentation instead.
